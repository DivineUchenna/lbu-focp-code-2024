# Lecture 07

This week we will look at an example program that illustrates much of what we have done so far.

We will include some file handling, which will involve the reuse of code from the previous lecture. 

The program is actually a slight variation one one from a previous lecture, with a small twist.

### The Problem: Racing Greyhounds

A greyhound trainer keeps records of his dogs in training. He times them as they run laps around his track, and records the times in a spreadsheet. He has exported a text file, and wishes to know the current average times of each dog.

The format of the file is the name of the hound, followed by the time. For example:

```text
Flash,60.45
Lightning,59.46
Flash,61.32
Eddie,55.21
Eddie,54.32
Flash,62.19
```

Since the file has been exported from an excellent spreadsheet program, it can be assumed that each line is correctly formatted as above.
